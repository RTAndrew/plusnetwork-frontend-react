## Technical Resume
This project is part of the Coodesh technical assessment, where I was tasked to create a web app that interacts with the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/documentation) and helps users find patient's medical information.

The project deadline was in 5 days, but I managed to do it in 3 days, covering all the test cases in the application.

For more information, please, have a look at the official [document.](https://lab.coodesh.com/insanityrodax/front-end-challenge-2021)
