# Plus Network - To Infinity & Beyond

## Resume
Imagine this scenario. We are in 2040, and on-site work is viewed with suspicion; everyone works from home, from the street, from the coffee shop, from another planet. The frontiers of remote work have become planetary, and we can work from Earth to a company on Mars and from Mars to a company on Earth.

## Technical Resume
This project is part of the Taikai Hackathon, that consisted in building a product where companies place job ads containing useful information for candidates such as:

- Job title;

- Short description;

- Necessary skills (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, React, Node.js);

- Company market (e.g., software house, healthcare, marketplaces);

- Job type (e.g., full time, contract, internship);

- Location;

## The Problem

The objective was to focus on the user experience whilst solving the common problems job seekers face such as abusive propaganda used by companies and navigating through thousands of jobs daily.

Nowadays, there are plenty of platforms that aim to make job-seeking much easier. Some of these resemble the look of an analytical dashboard. And in my personal opinion, it works and doesn't work. Why? Because most of the job searches (even those taken carefully) are based on the quantity. And one of the main reasons that it does not work is that the market is fierce, and so it leads to different results or outcomes:
- You may end up ghosted;
- No feedback is provided;
- You may have been rejected;
- Or luckily, you may have passed (yay!).

If you think about it, only one outcome out of the four is only interesting to you.

However, as someone who has been in the same situation and used different platforms along the process, I decided to tackle the "quantity problem" and reduce the amount of time spent finding the optimal job while increasing the amount of interaction of job posts per minute. Just like LinkedIn allows you to, and, for me, it's one of the best (in terms of quantity).
